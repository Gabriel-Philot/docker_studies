# DOCKER STUDIES

## Documentation

### [Link __Docs-Docker__  ](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/)

### [Link __docker hub__  (Repositorio de imagens)](https://hub.docker.com)

> [!Note] 
>My goal here was to review some basic Docker commands and concepts by building simple images and applications. I didn't want to explain the theoretical aspects of what Docker is, because there are many great online resources for that already.


> [!WARNING] 
> REQUERIMENTS : docker, python, some IDE  | All here where developed using WLS2 (Ubunto) in vscode.

**There's tons of good contents about how to install the requeriments.**

This studies had a good documentation on the commands needed to get it done in each item. So follow up the order or jump to the Second and third images if u got experencie already.
